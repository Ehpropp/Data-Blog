    Welcome to my data visualization and analysis blog!

    Have you ever looked for a visual of some data, but never found just the _right_ thing?
    Me too. And that's what prompted me to start this blog. I figured since I know exactly
    what I want to see, why not take the data and do it myself?

    I'm Eli Propp, a Computer Engineering Student at the University of Waterloo.

    The blog posts will be on a range of topics, but I'll be starting with finance. It'll be 
    oriented in a way that you can understand the entire topic with sources in the post,
    at least at a high level.

    Select the post page from the sidebar to start looking at any of the posts.

    Let me know if you have any tips or ideas for posts or the general website. I'm open to any ideas on how
    I can make this better.

    You can contact me from any of the links in the sidebar or about page.
