    Welcome to my data visualization and analysis blog!

    I'm Eli Propp, a Computer Engineering Student at the University of Waterloo.

    Currently I'm diving deeper into the world of data science, and to do so I realized I need to 
    become more comfortable working with data. So I figured, why not write create a blog and share 
    my findings with some hopefully nice visualizations?

    The blog posts will be on a range of topics, but I'll be starting with finance. It'll be 
    oriented in a way that you can understand the entire topic with sources in the post,
    at least at a high level.

    Select the post page from the sidebar to start looking at any of the posts.

    Let me know if you have any tips or ideas for posts or the general website. 
    I'm always open to any ideas on how I can make this better.

    You can contact me from any of the links in the sidebar or about page.
