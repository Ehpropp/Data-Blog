# Data Blog

This is the repository for my data blog, visualizing and analyzing data in easy to read way.

You can check out the blog here: [datavizblog.herokuapp.com](https://datavizblog.herokuapp.com/)

## About the App

The goal of this app is to share data visualizations on topics I find interesting.

Sometimes all the data is out there, but there isn't a decent visualization of exactly what you want. This happened to me a few times, so I decided I would just take the data and make what I want to see myself.

Making this app has also allowed me to practice using Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization. I talk about them a bit below in the Libraries section of the ReadMe.

## Topics

I plan on writing about mutliple different topics over time, but at the beginning I'll be focusing on finance and stock market visualizations.

## Posts

I'll try and maintain a list of the posts and specific repository folders here.

## Libraries

To create the app I used Streamlit. Streamlit is a Python library that allows for simple, elegant and rapid production of web apps that have anything to do with data. It was released in 2019 and they're always adding more to it, so I'm definitely excited to see what I can add to the blog.

To read and process the data I used Pandas. Pandas is an extremely useful open source Python library used to read, manipulate and analyze data.

The graphs were created using Seaborn. Seaborn is a Python library built ontop of Matplotlib used to create nice out-of-the-box charts for data visualization.
